When you're starting a new information security job, it's really important that you get started on the right foot.  First step is to take your time to really get to know the environment.  Ask lots of questions, help out where you can, really start to dig in and try to understand the network.  Having understanding like that will be very important as time goes on.

The same can be said for the people.  Getting to know the people whom you will be working with, supporting and communicating with is always a good investment of your time.  You never know when open lines of communication will benefit you, but you always know that they will at some point! The people who came before you often are the experts in their job.  They understand the who what why when and where questions.  But that doesn't mean you don't provide feedback!  

### Remember, you were selected for this job from a pool of applicants, they clearly saw something that they liked.  Be confident enough to excel at your job!

I recently experienced this in a very real way that will undoubtedly change the way a lot of things are done as things play out.

I was tasked with performing the annual audit of remote access capabilities!  The audit process was essentially as follows: pull a report from one tool.  Export the report into a CSV.  Cross reference it with a list from another report.  Manually transpose the document.  Plug it into a mail merge to create letters.  Copy and paste each letter from the mail merge into an email and send it to the manager in question.
