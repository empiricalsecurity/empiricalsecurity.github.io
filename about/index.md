Empirical Security is starting as a way of branching out, as well as giving back to the information security community.  I am still learning as an information security professional via training, studying, experience and observations and I wanted to create a place where I could share these experiences with others.

I will be adding some content to my github pages as appropriate.  Additionally, I have included Disqus links and the link to my twitter account if anyone wants to provide any feedback or comments.  

Information security is always changing so keep watching, listening and observing!
