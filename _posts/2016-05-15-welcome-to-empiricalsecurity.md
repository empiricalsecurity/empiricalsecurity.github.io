Welcome to Empirical Security.  I am an information security professional who work the blue team for my company.  This is an extremely challenging position, but one that is interesting, fulfilling and affords me the benefit of always having more to learn.  I am also a family man and working in information security is how I support my family.  They are the center of my world and everything I do is with them in mind.

Within the information security industry, if you're not learning then you're falling behind.  Most of the time, even if you are, you're still falling behind, so it's important to continually grow and learn.  That's what this blog is going to be about.  It's going to contain notes, observations, tools and references from an information security professional.  I am currently pursuing training opportunities as afforded to me by my employer, and studying for the CISSP outside of that.

To go a step farther, to assist in my daily duties as a blue teamer, I am also learning some of the aspects of pentesting in my down time.  I will likely be working through some vulnerable VMs and eventually also trying my hand at some bug bounties to increase my skills, and in the case of bug bounties, my bank account balance.

In programming, it all starts out with the HelloWorld application, so this is, in effect my HelloWorld.blog.  To start things off right, I'll get things started with a little ruby.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hello(name)
  puts "Hello world, welcome to #{name}!"
end
print_hello('Empirical Security')
#=> prints 'Hello world, welcome to Empirical Security!' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
